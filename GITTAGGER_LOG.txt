1.0 20150127T185446 Test commit 7
1.1 20150130T154918 Implemented first selections on 1 lepton, 1 btag, ht and leading jet pt
1.2 20150131T221930 Implemented n-minus-1 and all-cuts selections
1.3 20150201T195809 Only TTJets background, start weighting to lumi
1.4 20150202T154607 more statistics (2.5 mio ttbar events), use log scale
1.5 20150204T105351 Add more genhists (decay modes, dR between top daughters) and top tag multiplicity
1.6 20150206T114144 Added more GenHists and implemented GenSelection for signal efficiency
1.7 20150209T170309 From plot.py: New naming convention for hists and selection dirs
1.8 20150212T183120 From plot.py: Implemented AndSelections, re-designed AnalysisModule, changed histogram names -> on uhh2 branch master
