1.0 20150127T185446 Test commit 7
1.1 20150130T154918 Implemented first selections on 1 lepton, 1 btag, ht and leading jet pt
1.2 20150131T221930 Implemented n-minus-1 and all-cuts selections
1.3 20150201T195809 Only TTJets background, start weighting to lumi
1.4 20150202T154607 more statistics (2.5 mio ttbar events), use log scale
1.5 20150204T105351 Add more genhists (decay modes, dR between top daughters) and top tag multiplicity
1.6 20150206T114144 Added more GenHists and implemented GenSelection for signal efficiency
1.7 20150209T170309 From plot.py: New naming convention for hists and selection dirs
1.8 20150212T183120 From plot.py: Implemented AndSelections, re-designed AnalysisModule, changed histogram names -> on uhh2 branch master
1.9 20150213T122634 New Preselection, HT > 700, N_mu >= 1 (no Nelectron cut), jet1_pt > 200, jet2_pt > 50
1.10 20150215T213718 From plot.py: New histogram format, different categories (ElectronHists etc) now in different folders -> on uhh2 branch new-ntuple-format
1.11 20150215T225935 switched back to master - old ntuple format
1.12 20150216T105853 Ran over full samples, produce stacked plots -> used inclusive WJets/ZJets samples (low statistics in high-energy area) and no QCD
1.13 20150217T103243 From plot.py: Ran over binned samples, added QCD, no writing out of OutputTrees
1.14 20150217T110028 From plot.py: Test new plotter -> plot cf histos and other histos separately
